Explanation of the Code
Imports: The program imports the necessary libraries, numpy for numerical operations and matplotlib.pyplot for plotting.
Functions:
plot_linear(), plot_quadratic(), and plot_cubic() take coefficients as inputs and generate the corresponding 
ùë¶
y values based on the specified equation type.
Main Function:
Prompts the user to select the type of equation.
Collects the necessary coefficients based on the user's choice.
Calls the appropriate plotting function and generates the plot.
Plot Display: The program sets titles, labels, and gridlines for better visualization, and restricts the x-axis range from 0 to 50.
Running the Program
The user will run the script, make a selection, and input the required coefficients.
The corresponding graph will be displayed based on the chosen equation.
This exercise will help students understand how to work with functions, user input, and data visualization in Python!
